# ocr camera
A python application that scans images from the webcam and prints out the recorded text on the image.

## Required Packages

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the following packages:

Note: installations were all tested on Linux only.

OpenCV: for accessing and using the webcam from the application
```bash
pip install opencv-python
```

Tesseract: library for Optical Character Recognition
```bash
sudo-get install tesseract-ocr
```

## Usage
Start up the application using this command:
